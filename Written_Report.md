# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Performing analysis of Louise's Kickstarter campaign.

### Purpose

The purpose of performing the analysis of the Kickstarter campaign was to reveal trends. Because the dataset was large, which contained over 4000  crowdfunding projects, our class relied on advanced Excel features to easily visualize the hidden trends. Excel formulas, pivot tables and charts were the best methods used to analyze and visualize the patterns and trends.


## Analysis and Challenges

While working on this project, I was able to put in to practice advanced Excel skills that I had not used in a very long time. It was challenging, but also very interesting. To overcome the challenges, I repeated the exercises a few times to get the hang of it. Doing this, reinforced my skills and prepared me to successfully complete the following modules. 

I encountered some challenges during the VLOOKUP and COUNTIFS functions. However, some members of our class were willing to collaborate as a group to tackle these challenges together. We collaborated through group chats and zoom meetings. The outcome was very good since we were able to share our thoughts and ideas in order to learn from each other.

My main challenge, however, was experimenting with my Mac's Terminal and Git. These skills are very new to me and at the beginning I felt a little lost. However, with the help of my TAs, I was able to understand how most of it works. 

I had zero issues performing analysis using statistical methods such as central tendency, standard deviation, and variances. This is one of my favorite subjects, so I did extremely well handling the data using these methods. Overall, it was a great project to work on.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The analysis of the Kickstarter Campaign had a little over 4000 crowdfunding campaigns. Out of the 4000, almost 2200 were successful and 1500 failed. Outcomes based on launched date revealed that the months of May and June were the most successful and the month of April and October had the least amount of failed outcomes. I noticed a trend of down-spiral during the winter months, but quickly recovered when approaching summer. I began to wonder if there was a weather related connection for these actions. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The analysis of outcomes based on goal indicated most of the projects that needed to reach their goal were between the less than 1000 to 9000 mark. The highest goals reached was about 50,000, but only two out of 16 total projects. There was high expectations regarding the amounts of money needed. I say that it performed fair considering the large number of crowdfunding campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I found that the winter months were challenging for the Kickstarter Campaign. They may have had difficulties related to weather.



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. May into June were great months for the campaign.
2. October was a tough month for the campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The campaign set their expectations too high.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It does not give information on weather. This information may have been valuable.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Pie charts and X Y scatter could be useful.
