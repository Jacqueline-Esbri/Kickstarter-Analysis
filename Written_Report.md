# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Performing analysis of a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign.

### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis was to help an up-and-coming hypothetical playwright, named Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play. She was estimating a budget of over $10,000 and was hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. She needed someone with excel skills to help with the analysis. 

For this assignment, Excel was used to organize, sort, and analyze the crowdfunding data to determine whether there were specific factors to make a project's campaign successful. These insights were used to help her plan her own and set it up for success. 

Using Excel to analyze current site data, will help gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish. It will also enable to set up the campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category.


## Analysis and Challenges

When working with data, it is inevitable to encounter errors. Some errors occur due to a mistake, while others pop-up because Excel doesn't recognize a formula's output format, even if it is valid. Techniques used to fix errors vary. Sometimes errors are obscure and require research, while others have simpler fixes, such as correcting a typo. So, the errors were researched and solutions were incorporated to fix the problems.

Kickstarter required every campaign to have a fundraising goal. However, not every campaign had backers, which means, in some cases, there was no number to divide by in the formula (e.g., #DIV/0). While these errors did not hinder the research, they needed to be cleaned up.

There were no issues performing analysis using statistical methods such as central tendency, standard deviation, and variances. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The analysis of the Kickstarter Campaign had a little over 4,000 crowdfunding campaigns. Out of the 4,000, almost 2,200 were successful and 1,500 failed. Outcomes based on launched date revealed that the months of May and June were the most successful and the month of April and October had the least amount of failed outcomes. There was a trend of down-spiral during the winter months, but quickly recovered when approaching summer. I began to wonder if there was a weather related connection for these actions. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The analysis of outcomes based on goal indicated most of the projects that needed to reach their goal were between the less than $1,000 to $9,000 mark. The highest goals reached was about $50,000, but only two out of 16 total projects reached that goal. There was high expectations regarding the amounts of money needed; however, the performance was fair considering the large number of crowdfunding campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It was found that the winter months were challenging for the Kickstarter Campaign. They may have had difficulties related to weather.



## Results

**What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

- May into June were great months for the campaign.
- October was a tough month for the campaign.

**What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

- The campaign set their expectations too high.

**What are some limitations of this dataset?**

- It did not provide information on weather. This information may have been valuable.

**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

- Pie charts and X Y scatter could have been more useful.
